                    <p>Most students have the history of struggling with mathematics assignments which make them wonder if they will ever apply the knowledgein real world life. Teachers and parents admit having been asked about the relevance of mathematics in life. Some often respond that mathematics is necessary for most of the jobs and it enhances critical thinking skills of an individual. Such responses may be good but fail to address immediate needs of a student. There are various everyday practical applications of mathematics.</p>
                    <p>The most common and essential application of mathematics in daily 
                    life is in financial management like spending, investing and saving. The modern world is money-driven and therefore, demands knowledge in 
                    mathematics to help in various calculations. Inability to add, subtract, multiply or divide will result in serious difficulties when handling 
                    money. One requires mathematical skills beyond the basic arithmetic concepts because complex algebra is necessary when calculating interest 
                    rates for loans and investments. Even those who manage their own money will often require dealing with loans and investment. Besides, one 
                    should be familiar with exponential growth calculations to plan for future projections especially in spending of money.</p>

                    <p><p>When most people first thing of the term mathematics or the word "algebra", they don't get too excited. Most people tend to <br>say "I hate math!" or the big one, "When are we ever going to use it in our lives." The fact is that algebra will be used <br>in our lives whether we know it or not. For instance, if we were to attend a football game all it is, is one big math problem.<br>In football mathematics can be used in a variety of differnt ways. It can be used in the game itself, the business portion eg selling tickets, the building of the stadium. Without math the world would not be the same as we knw it to be today
                        </p>
                        <p> One way that we can apply math or algebra to the game of football is trying to find out the revenue collected by ticket <br>sales. Without the use of algebra a football team owner couldn't accurately calculate incoming revenues. Most likely he <br>would be losing more money then he would be making. A professional football team is based on a salary cap. There is billions <br>of dollars invested in the sport and the money needs to be keeping track of.</p>
                        <p> Another way that algebra could be used in the game of football is trying to find the total gain or loss of yards made by <br>the players. This is good for player stats as well as game stats. In football you can use algebra to try and determine <br>how much further you have to go to score or attempt a field goal. These can be major factors in a very close game to plan out <br>a good strategy. This game is basically about skill and strategy and math can be a tool that can lead to success in both areas.</p>
                        <p> The more major part in football that can use math is the building of the stadium. To build a good stadium for fans to be <br>entertained you must have perfect calculations. More importantly is the safety of the people. If an engineer just threw <br>a football stadium together, chances are is that it won't be safe for not only fans but the players as well. So math plays a <br>huge role in every aspect </p></p>

                    <p>Mathematics concepts are very significant in the management of time. Time factor affects everyone around the world. Time is, therefore, a 
                        very valuable asset that cannot be ignored. The modern competitive world demands very proper planning of time to avoid lagging behind as others 
                        make progress. Failing to keep schedule results in accumulation of things not done in the required time frame. Mathematics comes into play 
                        when organizing to-do lists where the rating of tasks varies depending on the priority and urgency. Organising a schedule is, therefore, beyond
                            the simple knowledge of reading the clock or calendar; more application of mathematics is necessary.</p>
                        <p>In addition, mathematics is applied every day in the grocery stores. 
                        This sector requires an accurate use of mathematics knowledge such as 
                        estimation, multiplications, and percentages. The sellers apply 
                        mathematics in the calculation of price per unit, estimating the 
                        percentage of discounts offered, measuring the weight of products and 
                        estimating of the net price required to sell or buy a product. 
                        Mathematics in the grocery stores is the best example of its application
                            in sectors affecting everyone and every day.</p>

                    <p>Closely related is the application of mathematics in the kitchen. 
                        Recipes for different foods vary either in terms of ingredients used or 
                        simply by the number of ingredients. Preparing the recipes requires a 
                        step-by-step operation steps similar to algorithms. Some of the 
                        mathematical applications include: measuring of ingredients, converting 
                        of temperatures necessary in the preparation of different foods, 
                        calculation of cooking duration for each item, and calculation of ratio 
                        and proportions, especially in baking.</p>
                        <p>Another daily application of mathematics happens in traveling. It 
                        helps to take away risks associated with traveling. Before one starts a 
                        journey, they have to estimate different factors such as the amount of 
                        fuel to be used per distance and hour. This is crucial for long distance
                            travelers since there is a risk of exhausting the available fuel and 
                        remain stranded on the road. Mathematics still come into play when 
                        paying for tolls, determining the tire pressure, checking the numbers of
                            exit and others. Besides, mathematics is crucial when using maps during
                            the road trip in the absence of GPS and Google Maps. One should find 
                        their current location and how to move to the destination. Basic 
                        mathematics fundamentals are applied in such instances.</p>
                        <p>Basing on the above daily applications and others, it is evident that
                            knowledge in mathematics is necessary and relevant to everyone 
                        regardless of the occupations and status they occupy in the society.</p>
